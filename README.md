## Recent Work

### ⏱ [TapCount](https://tapcount.ianjmacintosh.com/) ([source](https://www.github.com/ianjmacintosh/tapcount))

TapCount is a utility app (Android | iOS | [Web](https://tapcount.ianjmacintosh.com/)) to help count anything and know how long counting took. I imagined this would just be an exercise app (_"How long does it takes to do 100 burpees?"_), but you can use it to measure anything where time matters.

- Built with React
- Tested with Jest and Testing Library (81.7% code coverage)
- Transpiled for Android and iOS using Apache Cordova

### 🕹 [Pozo](https://pozo.ianjmacintosh.com/) ([source](https://www.github.com/ianjmacintosh/pozo))

After finishing Wes Bos's premium React course, I built something on my own: a clone of a 1990's console arcade puzzle game. I learned a lot on the way by playing the role of lead developer, designer, sound engineer, project manager, and quality engineer.

- Built with React
- Unit tested with Jest
- Animated SVGs using Greensock (GSAP)
- Layout managed with CSS Grid

### 🎩 [Ian J MacIntosh.com](https://www.ianjmacintosh.com)

I built my personal site to share knowledge, ranging from technical _How To_ guides to travel advice. I made my site fast, secure, and cheap by using the JAMstack. I made testing and deploying an absolute breeze by taking advantage of modern pipeline tooling.

- Built with Eleventy
- Content managed with Contentful CMS
- Hosted by Netlify
- Pipeline built with Netlify's Continuous Deployment tools, GitHub Actions, Lighthouse CI, and Cypress
- Layout managed with CSS Grid and Flexbox
