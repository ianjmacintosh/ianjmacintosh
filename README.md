# About Me

My name's Ian MacIntosh, I help engineering teams perform even better. This means focusing on the everyday stuff, so the easy things are easy and the hard things are possible. I demonstrate how to practice good Git habits, make tickets easy to write and easier to read, perform regular code reviews with clear feedback, ensure preview environments are quickly and reliably deployed, and write documentation that reads like a series of useful tweets instead of a series of classic textbooks.

_"If you don't actively fight for simplicity in software, complexity will win... and it will suck."_— [Henrik Joreteg](https://joreteg.com/blog/architecting-uis-for-change)

My last title was "Architect" and before that was "Principal Software Engineer," but I still like getting my hands dirty with personal projects. It's hard to lead without the understanding you can only get from hands-on experience.

## ⏱ [TapCount](https://tapcount.ianjmacintosh.com/) ([source](https://www.github.com/ianjmacintosh/tapcount))

TapCount is a utility app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ianjmacintosh.tapcount) | iOS | [Web](https://tapcount.ianjmacintosh.com/)) to help count anything and know how long counting took. I imagined this would just be an exercise app (_"How long does it takes to do 100 burpees?"_), but you can use it to measure anything where time matters.

- Built with React
- Tested with Jest and Testing Library (81.7% code coverage)
- Transpiled for Android and iOS using Apache Cordova

## 🕹 [Pozo](https://pozo.ianjmacintosh.com/) ([source](https://www.github.com/ianjmacintosh/pozo))

After finishing Wes Bos's premium React course, I built something on my own: a clone of a 1990's console arcade puzzle game. I learned a lot on the way by playing the role of lead developer, designer, sound engineer, project manager, and quality engineer.

- Built with React
- Unit tested with Jest
- Animated SVGs using Greensock (GSAP)
- Layout managed with CSS Grid

## 🎩 [Ian J MacIntosh.com](https://www.ianjmacintosh.com)

I built my personal site to share knowledge, ranging from technical _How To_ guides to travel advice. I made my site fast, secure, and cheap by using the JAMstack. I made testing and deploying an absolute breeze by taking advantage of modern pipeline tooling.

- Built with Eleventy
- Content managed with Contentful CMS
- Hosted by Netlify
- Pipeline built with Netlify's Continuous Deployment tools, GitHub Actions, Lighthouse CI, and Cypress
- Layout managed with CSS Grid and Flexbox
