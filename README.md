### About Me

My name's Ian MacIntosh, I help engineering teams perform even better. My favorite way to do that is by getting hands-on experience (starting with the `README.md`) so I can better understand when engineers from different teams explain their day-to-day challenges.

Taking the time to listen yields value almost immediately; I can help come up with a game plan for the next big deliverable (and know who to run it by before committing to it), spot the small issue that's causing big problems, and present requests to responsible teams in the context and terms they need in order to deliver effectively.

My last title was "Architect" and before that was "Principal Software Engineer," but I still enjoy getting my hands dirty with personal projects.
