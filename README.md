### About Me

My name's Ian MacIntosh, I help engineering teams perform even better. My favorite way to do that is by getting hands-on experience with their projects (starting with the `README.md`), allowing me to understand engineers when they explain their day-to-day challenges.

Taking the time to listen yields value almost immediately; I can help come up with a game plan for the next big deliverable (and know who to run it by before committing to it), spot when small issues cause big problems, and present requests to responsible teams in the context and terms they need in order to deliver effectively.

My last title was "Architect" and before that was "Principal Software Engineer," but I still enjoy getting my hands dirty with personal projects.

### Recent Work

#### [TapCount](https://tapcount.ianjmacintosh.com/) ([source](https://www.github.com/ianjmacintosh/tapcount))

TapCount is a utility app (Android | iOS | [Web](https://tapcount.ianjmacintosh.com/)) to help you count anything and know how long counting took. I imagined this would just be an exercise app (_"How long does it takes to do 100 burpees?"_), but you can use it to measure anything where time matters.

- Built with React
- Tested with Jest and Testing Library (81.7% code coverage)
- Transpiled for Android and iOS using Apache Cordova

#### [Ian J MacIntosh.com](https://www.ianjmacintosh.com)

I built my personal site to share knowledge about things I've learned, ranging from technical _How To_ guides to recommendations for handling practical matters while traveling overseas. By using a static site generator (SSG) and "the JAMstack," I made my site fast, secure, and cheap. By using modern pipeline tooling like Netlify Deploy Previews and GitHub Actions, testing and deploying is an absolute breeze.

- Built using Eleventy
- Content managed with Contentful CMS
- Hosted by Netlify
- Pipeline built with Netlify's Continuous Deployment tools, GitHub Actions, Lighthouse CI, and Cypress
- Layout managed with CSS Grid

#### [Pozo](https://pozo.ianjmacintosh.com/) ([source](https://www.github.com/ianjmacintosh/pozo))

After finishing up Wes Bos's premium React course, I wanted to use what I'd learned to build something on my own. I made a clone of a 1990's console arcade puzzle game and learned a lot on the way by playing the role of lead developer, designer, sound engineer, project manager, and quality engineer.

- User interface built with React
- Unit tested with Jest
- Animated SVGs using Greensock (GSAP)
- Layout managed with CSS Grid
